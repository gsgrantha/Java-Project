# Java-Project
A Java Swing–based desktop application to manage university transport assignments and records using OOP and file handling.


# 🚍 University Transport Management System (UTMS)

The **University Transport Management System (UTMS)** is a Java-based desktop application developed to manage transportation facilities for university students and staff. This system allows assigning buses or cars, managing pickup and drop routes, and storing transport records efficiently using file handling.

The project is built following **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and provides a **user-friendly graphical interface using Java Swing**. No database is used; all data is stored locally in text files.
